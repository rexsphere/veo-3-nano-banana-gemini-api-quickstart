# üîê Security FAQ - Your Questions Answered

## ‚ùì Is my secret JSON exposed if I put this on GitHub?

### **Short Answer: NO - if you follow the setup correctly! ‚úÖ**

The `.gitignore` file is configured to **automatically prevent** sensitive files from being committed:

```gitignore
# Environment files (NEVER committed)
.env*.local
.env.local
.env

# Firebase service accounts (NEVER committed)
firebase-adminsdk-*.json
serviceAccount*.json
*-firebase-adminsdk-*.json

# Other sensitive files
*.key
*.pem
secret*.json
```

### What's Safe vs What's NOT Safe:

#### ‚úÖ **SAFE to commit to GitHub:**
```bash
# Public Firebase config (these are meant to be public)
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY="AIza..."
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="..."
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="..."
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="..."
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="..."
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID="..."
```

These are **safe because**:
- They're already exposed in the browser
- Firebase protects them with domain restrictions
- They require additional security rules to actually access data

#### ‚ùå **NEVER commit to GitHub:**
```bash
# These are PRIVATE and should NEVER be in Git
GEMINI_API_KEY="..."
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="..."
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY_ID="..."
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL="..."
FIREBASE_CLIENT_ID="..."
```

These are **dangerous because**:
- They give full access to your Firebase project
- They can be used to make API calls that cost money
- Anyone with these can impersonate your server

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### 1. **Check Before Committing**

Before running `git push`, always check:

```bash
# See what files will be committed
git status

# If you see .env.local or *.json files, STOP!
# Make sure .gitignore is working
```

### 2. **If You Accidentally Committed Secrets**

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**

```bash
# 1. Remove from Git history (if just committed)
git reset --soft HEAD~1
git reset HEAD .env.local
git commit -m "Remove sensitive files"

# 2. If already pushed to GitHub - ROTATE ALL KEYS IMMEDIATELY:
```

Then:
- **Regenerate** your Firebase service account
- **Regenerate** your Gemini API key
- Update `.env.local` with new keys
- **Never** use the old keys again

### 3. **Use Environment Variables in Production**

When deploying to Vercel/Netlify:
- Add secrets through the platform's dashboard
- **Never** commit `.env.local` to access them in production
- The hosting platform securely injects them at runtime

---

## üîç How to Verify Your Setup is Secure

### Checklist:

- [ ] `.env.local` exists and has your secrets
- [ ] `.env.local` is listed in `.gitignore`
- [ ] Run `git status` - `.env.local` should NOT appear
- [ ] Service account JSON file is NOT in your repository
- [ ] Firebase rules are set to require authentication
- [ ] Production secrets are in Vercel/Netlify dashboard, not in code

### Test Your .gitignore:

```bash
# This should return NOTHING:
git status | grep -E ".env.local|firebase.*json"

# If it shows files, your .gitignore is not working!
```

## üåê Firebase Security Layers

Firebase provides **multiple security layers**:

1. **API Key (Public)**: Just identifies your project
2. **Domain Restrictions**: Only your domains can use Firebase
3. **Authentication**: Users must sign in
4. **Security Rules**: Control what authenticated users can access
5. **Private Key (Server)**: Only your server can admin operations

Even if someone gets your public API key, they:
- ‚úÖ Can't access your server functions
- ‚úÖ Can't bypass authentication
- ‚úÖ Can't access data without proper rules
- ‚ùå **BUT** they could attempt to use your Auth (why domain restrictions matter)

---

## üí° Best Practices Summary

### DO ‚úÖ
- Use `.env.local` for local development
- Use environment variables in production (Vercel dashboard)
- Keep `.gitignore` up to date
- Regularly review what's committed to Git
- Use different API keys for dev/prod
- Monitor your API usage in Google Cloud Console

### DON'T ‚ùå
- Commit `.env` files to Git
- Hard-code secrets in source code
- Share your service account JSON
- Use production keys in development
- Ignore security warnings
- Skip domain restrictions in Firebase

---

## üö® If You Think Your Keys Are Compromised

**Immediate Actions:**

1. **Revoke the keys:**
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Navigate to APIs & Services ‚Üí Credentials
   - Delete the compromised key

2. **Generate new keys:**
   - Create new service account
   - Generate new Gemini API key
   - Update your `.env.local`

3. **Update production:**
   - Update environment variables in Vercel/Netlify
   - Redeploy your application

4. **Monitor:**
   - Check Firebase Usage & Billing
   - Check Gemini API Usage
   - Look for unusual activity

---

## üìä Monitoring & Alerts

Set up billing alerts to catch unauthorized usage:

### Google Cloud (Gemini API):
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Billing ‚Üí Budgets & alerts
3. Create budget alert (e.g., $10/month)
4. Get email notifications

### Firebase:
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Project settings ‚Üí Usage and billing
3. Set up Spark plan limits
4. Monitor daily usage

---

## ‚úÖ Your Setup is Secure When:

- [x] `.env.local` is in `.gitignore`
- [x] No secrets in your GitHub repository
- [x] Service account JSON is stored locally only
- [x] Production secrets are in hosting platform dashboard
- [x] Firebase domain restrictions are enabled
- [x] Billing alerts are configured
- [x] You're monitoring API usage regularly

**Follow these practices and your application will be production-ready and secure!** üîí
